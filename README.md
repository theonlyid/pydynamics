# PyDynamics

## A Python package for analysis of timeseries data using dynamical systems and differential equations

PyDynamics is a Python package designed to facilitate the analysis of timeseries data through the application of dynamical systems and differential equations. This package provides tools for modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex systems that evolve over time.

Author: Ali Zaidi

Version: 0.0.1

## Features

- Model timeseries data using differential equations
- Simulate the behavior of dynamical systems
- Estimate parameters, variance and likelihood (p-values, t-test)
- Visualize timeseries data and system trajectories

## Installation

0. Clone the repo by running `$git clone https://github.com/theonlyid/pydynamics.git`. This is the best option. Alternatively use Github Desktop to download the repo. You can also download the code using the browser, but this won't allow you to pull updates.

1. Activate your preferred conda or pyenv environment.

2. Navigate to the project's root folder and install the package using pip:

```bash
$ pip install .
```

3. Test the installation with Python:

```bash
$ python -c "import pydynamics; print('PyDynamics installed successfully')"
```
